  <p>When they see that syndication  all the dope boys GO CRAZY!!!  Sorry. I've been stuck on that Young Jeezy song for a little while now.  RSS feeds  for <a href="http://www.noesbueno.com/musical/">musiCal</a> are up and running.  What's musiCal, you ask?  It's a mashup app that takes your top 50 artists from <a href="http://www.last.fm">last.fm</a> and checks to see if any of them are playing in your metros from <a href="http://www.upcoming.org">upcoming.org</a>.</p>
