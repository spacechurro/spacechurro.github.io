  <p>I busted out my copy of Jeff Mills' "Live at the Liquid Room" mix a couple of days ago and was remembering how big of a fan I used to be.  He was Greek tragedy for the 20th century.  I took a philosophy class in college, and what I remember was learning about Greek tragedy being all about balancing the Apollonian and the Dionysian.  The Apollonian was the dialogue in the tragedies because they were clean, ordered, and calculated.  The chorus in the tragedies were Dionysian because they would made you get all buck wild.  They were all about passion and excess.  Jeff Mills would take these techno tracks which were Apollonian.  They were all about structure and boundaries.  The things he did to them, though, were very, very dirty and Dionysian.  He was quick and dirty in his mixing style.  You could hear him mess up every once and a while, but it didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t matter because blurring these tracks to shit and it sounded amazing.  There is my lucid thought for the month.  </p>
