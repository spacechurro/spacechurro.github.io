  <p>I just picked up the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B0002W1AH8/103-2655361-1328661">Late Night Tales comp. by Four Tet</a> yesterday and I was pleasantly surprised.  Some songs get a little kooky, but there are some real gems on there.  I never had the first Gravediggaz album, but I'm definitely gonna check it out after hearing "2 Cups of Blood".  Koushik's "Battle Rhymes for Battle Times" is also equally hot.  </p>
