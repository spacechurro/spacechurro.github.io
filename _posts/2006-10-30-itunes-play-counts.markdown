  <p>I just took a gander at my most played songs in itunes and was kinda creeped out by the results.  At the top of the list was Prince's 'I Would Die 4 U'.  I've listened to it 5732 times since March of 2004.  That comes out to almost 12 days.  Dayum!</p>
  <p><strong>edit:</strong> err....scratch that.  itunes is now saying Ive played this same song 11464 times.  stupid broken itunes...</p>
