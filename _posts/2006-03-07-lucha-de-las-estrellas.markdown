  <p>I was thinking it would be pretty cool to have a game like <a href="http://www.ea.com/official/defjam/fightforny/us/home.jsp">Def Jam: Fight for New York</a> , but with some classic (or not-so-classic) latino singers.  Who would you pick and what would their special move be? Here is what I got so far:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Pedro Infante - throws his charro hat Kung Lao style</li>
  <li>Vicente Fernandez - pulls a tequila bottle out of his back pocket and spits fire</li>
  <li>Jose Feliciano - shoots bad ass lazer beams from his eyes</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Comments are open.  Let me know what you got.</p>
