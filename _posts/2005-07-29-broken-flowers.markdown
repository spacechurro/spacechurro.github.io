  <p>The new Jim Jarmusch movie isn't looking half bad.  I didn't really like Coffee & Cigarettes too much, but the skit with Bill, the RZA, and the GZA was comedy gold.  I was kinda hoping to see the Ghost Dawg,  Forest Whitaker, in this romantic comedy, but I guess Bill Murray will do.  <a href="http://brokenflowersmovie.com/">Check out the trailer</a>.</p>
