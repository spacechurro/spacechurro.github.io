  <p>I always enjoyed playing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Kage">The Legend of Kage</a> as a kid.  The first time I played it was at an arcade in Mexico and I remember it having the coolest backdrop I had ever seen in a game. I went back to playing it this week and the landscape still holds up for me.  I did up a desktop wallpaper with a couple of tweaks for my pc at home and figured I'd make em in a couple of other sizes in case anyone else wanted them.  Here they are: </p>
