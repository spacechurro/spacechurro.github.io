  <p><a href="http://www.dreamhost.com">Dreamhost</a> was upgrading rails to 1.1 and in the process, broke everyone's rails apps on their servers.  That's pretty ghetto.  I hope <a href="http://noesbueno.com/musical/">musiCal</a> will be up soon, but I have no ETA. Maybe its time to switch to <a href="http://www.textdrive.com">TextDrive</a>.</p>
