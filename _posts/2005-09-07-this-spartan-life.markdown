  <p>This is the first in-game talk show I've ever heard of.  The host, Damian Lacedaemion, interviews people in multiplayer levels of Halo 2 over xbox live.  They also have the Solid Gold Elite Dancers, who do dance routines to 8 bit music. <a href="http://www.thisspartanlife.com/">check it out</a></p>
