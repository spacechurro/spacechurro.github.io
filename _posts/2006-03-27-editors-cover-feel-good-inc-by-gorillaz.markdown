  <p>Editors were on <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/jowhiley/">Radio 1</a> a couple of weeks ago and they did a great cover of Feel Good, Inc. from Gorillaz (they threw in a little Munich too).    The audio is up for download, but the site it's on is a little goofy.  Wait a bit for the page to load and the files should appear at the bottom.  <a href="http://www.savefile.com/projects.php?pid=600004">Here is the link</a>.</p>
