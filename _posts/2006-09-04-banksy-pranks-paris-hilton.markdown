  <p><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/5310416.stm">Banksy switched out 500 copies of Paris Hilton's new album</a> with his own version at 42 stores In England. His version of the album had his own remixes on the CD with titles like "Every CD you buy puts me even further out of your league" as well as a naked pic of Paris as the cover art. The genius part is that he kept the bar code the same so that people wouldn't realize they were buying his copy. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxUl9Mxbh1E">Check out the video of how it went down.</a> <span class="via">(via <a href="http://www.papelcontinuo.net/">Papel Continuo</a>)</span></p>
