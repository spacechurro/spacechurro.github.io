  <p>I snagged the "Internet Invasion" mixtape from DJ Green Lantern and Ghostface Killah.  I don't know that hip-hop and the internet necessarily go together.  Here are some of my favorite parts:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Ghostdini: "I wanna shout out to message boards and all the blogs out there, you know what I mean, gettin' our shit on and shit."</li>
  <li>Green Lantern shouting out his MySpace page.  WTF?</li>
  <li>Ghostface giving props to iTunes, AOL Music, Yahoo! Music, and OkayPlayer.com. Weird.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>A blogger named Spawn has the <a href="http://ganstarap.blogspot.com/2006/02/dj-green-lantern-ghostface-killah.html">whole thing available for download</a> on his site.  </p>
