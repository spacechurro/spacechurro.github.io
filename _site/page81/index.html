  <p>I just took a gander at my most played songs in itunes and was kinda creeped out by the results.  At the top of the list was Prince's 'I Would Die 4 U'.  I've listened to it 5732 times since March of 2004.  That comes out to almost 12 days.  Dayum!</p>
<p><strong>edit:</strong> err....scratch that.  itunes is now saying Ive played this same song 11464 times.  stupid broken itunes...</p>

  <p>I was sick of going through hoops to convert a playlist created in iTunes into an .m3u playlist that my xbox 360 would be able to see.  I started looking for a program to ease the pain on the intertron and I found <a href="http://www.ericdaugherty.com/dev/itunesexport/">Eric Daugherty's iTunes Export</a>.  All I had to do was queue it up in my scheduled tasks and now I have all my playlists exported as .m3u files daily.  Here's how you can do it too.</p>
<ol>
<li>Download the <a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/itunesexport/iTunesExport.Console-1.0.2.zip?download">console version of iTunes Export</a>.</li>
<li>iTunes Export creates playlists in the directory it runs from, so put it in a directory that's accessible by <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/devices/wmconnect/">Windows Media Connect</a>.</li>
<li>Open up "Scheduled Tasks" (programs > accessories > system tools > scheduled tasks).</li>
<li>Drag and drop the iTunes Export icon into the "Scheduled Tasks" window.  Windows will set the program to run everyday at 9am.</li>
</ol>

His version of the album had his own remixes on the CD with titles like "Every CD you buy puts me even further out of your league" as well as a naked pic of Paris as the cover art. The genius part is that he kept the bar code the same so that people wouldn't realize they were buying his copy. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxUl9Mxbh1E">Check out the video of how it went down.</a> <span class="via">(via <a href="http://www.papelcontinuo.net/">Papel Continuo</a>)</span></p>

  <p>That was my best take at a  Joel Siegel style title.  So the WB is modernizing Thundercats to be launched as a new series and it looks really bad.  My favorite parts are that they now play in a rock band and Snarf is their leader.  <a href="http://www.iwatchstuff.com/2006/08/thundercats_join_a_band.html">I Watch Stuff!</a> has the rest of the story.</p>
