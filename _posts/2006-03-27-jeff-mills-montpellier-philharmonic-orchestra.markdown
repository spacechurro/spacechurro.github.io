  <p>Whats Jeff Mills up to these days?  I took a gander on the interTron and saw that last summer he performed some of his tracks with the Montpellier Philharmonic Orchestra in the south of France.  That's right.  A bunch of lucky frenchies got to hear 'The Bells'  performed live by the wizard and an orchestra.  Why couldn't the bastard do that here in Chicago when played at summerdance?  </p>
