  <p>Now, I don't read kottke, but....just kidding, his site is great.  He posted a link to a <a href="http://www.formdiplo.com/">Diplo</a> mix of <a href="http://www.djshadow.com/">DJ Shadow</a>'s samples in his list of 2005 favorites which is some serious hot shit.  Hearing the vocals for "Six Days" over Terror Squad's "Lean Back" made my day.  <a href="http://www.archive.org/details/DiploMegatroidMix01megatroidmixsoupmp3">Download it!</a></p>
