  <p>I was sick of going through hoops to convert a playlist created in iTunes into an .m3u playlist that my xbox 360 would be able to see.  I started looking for a program to ease the pain on the intertron and I found <a href="http://www.ericdaugherty.com/dev/itunesexport/">Eric Daugherty's iTunes Export</a>.  All I had to do was queue it up in my scheduled tasks and now I have all my playlists exported as .m3u files daily.  Here's how you can do it too.</p>
  <ol>
  <li>Download the <a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/itunesexport/iTunesExport.Console-1.0.2.zip?download">console version of iTunes Export</a>.</li>
  <li>iTunes Export creates playlists in the directory it runs from, so put it in a directory that's accessible by <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/devices/wmconnect/">Windows Media Connect</a>.</li>
  <li>Open up "Scheduled Tasks" (programs > accessories > system tools > scheduled tasks).</li>
  <li>Drag and drop the iTunes Export icon into the "Scheduled Tasks" window.  Windows will set the program to run everyday at 9am.</li>
  </ol>
