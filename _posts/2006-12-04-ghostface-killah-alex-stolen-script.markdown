  <p>I snagged a copy of the new Ghostface album, More Fish, and listened through it once.Â  Good lord!Â  That Alex track is scrumtralescent.Â  <a href="http://www.prefixmag.com/media/ghostface/alex-stolen-script-mp3/2703">Prefixmag has a copy of it up on their site.</a>Â  If you're sneaky, you can find the hard link to the mp3 file in the page source.</p>
