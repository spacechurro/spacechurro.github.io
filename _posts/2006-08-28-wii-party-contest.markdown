  <p>My  friend El Moco (thats 'the moco' in english) over at <a href="http://www.endangeredgamer.blogspot.com/">Endangered Gamer</a> is giving away 2 tickets to a wii preview party sponsored by Nintendo.  All you gotta do is show up on September 8th @ Harrison Park in Chicago and say why you deserve 'em.  The two people who prove to be the biggest fanboys win tickets. Check out <a href="http://endangeredgamer.blogspot.com/2006/08/wii-party-contest.html">his post for more info</a>.</p>
