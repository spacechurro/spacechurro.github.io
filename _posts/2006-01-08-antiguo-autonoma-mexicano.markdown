  <p>Antiguo Autonoma Mexicano does chill electronic music out of Mexico and it is very good stuff.  Check out <a href="http://www.rebelionantioxidantes.com/entrevistas/entrevistasexperimental.htm">this mix</a> he did for a radio station in Barcelona.  According to <a href="http://www.staticdiscos.com/">Static Discos</a>, he should have a new album coming in '06. </p>
