  <p>I picked up the new <a href="http://www.theadvantageband.com">Advantage</a> album, Elf-Titled,  and I like it  a lot more than their first album.  The do a rendition of the moon level from Ducktails which is awesome and they've also got the alien's lair from Contra and Kraid's lair from Metroid. </p>
