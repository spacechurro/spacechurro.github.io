  <p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/27/science/27side.html">The New York times has an article </a>on how the <span class="title">Aymaran Indians have an inverted view of future and past.  </span>They see the past as something you know about so it lies in front of you.  They call it <em>nayra pacha/timpu,</em> or 'front time'.  The future is a mystery so it lies behind you where you can't see it.  That's <em>qhipa pacha/timpu</em> or 'behind time'. It kinda reminds me of that crunchy song from Madvillian album feat. Lord Quas, Shadows of Tomorrow. <span class="via">(via <a href="http://www.collisiondetection.net/">Collision Detection</a>)</span></p>
